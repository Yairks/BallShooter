BALL SHOOTER

Written in Java. I made this game back in summer 2018 to experiment with a scrolling screen in a game.

Ball Shooter is a game where the objective is for a player (controlling a stickfigure)
to successfully destroy all the enemy balls using the arrow keys and the spacebar.

To play, just download the .jar file in /out/.

Enjoy!
