BALL SHOOTER

Written in Java

Ball Shooter is a game where the objective is for a player (controlling a stickfigure)
to successfully destroy all the enemy balls using the arrow keys and the spacebar.
Unfortunately, it is not available online in jar form. However, the pictures for the game
are stored on Github, so you can download and play the entire game if you so desire.
Runs on Java 8. Check back soon for updates!
